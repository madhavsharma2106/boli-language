# Boli

Boli is a [Lisp](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)>) inspired programming language that is developed to be used in Hindi.

The following is a code-along from a great course by [Steve Kinney](https://twitter.com/stevekinney?lang=en) on [Front End Masters](https://frontendmasters.com/workshops/build-your-own-programming-language/)

## Inspiration

There are many reasons I've always wanted to build a programming language. I've listed a few of them below.

- Programming languages have always been mystical for me. I have always wanted to understand what happens below the hood.
- I've always wondered what the world would look like if a Hindi speaking population had dominated the pre-programming era. Computers would have been programmed in Hindi and I would be typing this in Devanagari (The Hindi script). This language is my escapist view of what tha world would look like.

## Syntax

Just like lisp, Bolo also is very simple. In its currrent edition, bolo can perform 8 operations:

- jama (add)
- ghata (subtract)
- guna (multiply)
- bhag (divide)
- sapeksh (modulo)
- pi
- log
- adhiktam (max)
- manlo (declare a variable)

## Usage
